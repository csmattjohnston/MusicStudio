  "body": "## Background\r\nIn 2013 I started creating music beats using FL Studio. I loved the product but thought it would be a great challenge to create my own music studio program. I presented this program to 30+ people at The University of Vermont's Computer Science Fair. After much research about Java's audio library and GUI libraries, I started to create this program. \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nIn 2013, I did not have much concept about efficiency and optimization so, my code is very spaghetti like. It is my goal to refractor the code to make it more efficient, faster and readable. I do know that I can eliminate some of the nested for loops, unused variables and unneeded object references. \r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\nFeel free to contribute to this project and if you have any questions or comments, please contact me.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me at [johnston.matt.vt@gmail.com](mailto:johnston.matt.vt@gmail.com) for questions and solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
